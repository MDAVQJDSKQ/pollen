      I'm Liam and I'm a philosophy major at KSU with a minor in professional writing. I have a passion for exploring and expressing ideas. Inspired by a deep curiosity for humanity and the world we live in, I am constantly in search of new perspectives and experiences to lend me an upper hand in the Age of Information. With my advanced compositions skills and mastery of the english language, I am a valuable asset for research and communication projects. Peace.
